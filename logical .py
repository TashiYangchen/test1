# Example 1
x = 5
print(x>3 and x<10) #True because both conditions are True
# Example 2
y = 12 
print(y<10 or y%2 == 0) #True because the second condition is True

## Not operator
# Example 1
x = 5
print(not(x>3 and x<10)) #False because the condition inside the not is true
# Example 2
y = 12 
print(not(y<10 or y%5 == 0)) #True because the condition inside the not is false
